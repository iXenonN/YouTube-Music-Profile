<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   The project continuously monitors and displays the song you're currently listening to on YouTube Music directly on your GitHub profile. It updates in real-time ensuring your profile always shows the latest track.
*   When YouTube Music is not running or the application is offline the project gracefully switches to a default message or image indicating that no song is currently being played.
*   As an open-source project it encourages community contributions allowing users to suggest features report bugs or even develop plugins to extend its functionality.
