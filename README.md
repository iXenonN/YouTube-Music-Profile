<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   The project continuously monitors and displays the song you're currently listening to on YouTube Music directly on your GitHub profile. It updates in real-time ensuring your profile always shows the latest track.
*   When YouTube Music is not running or the application is offline the project gracefully switches to a default message or image indicating that no song is currently being played.
*   As an open-source project it encourages community contributions allowing users to suggest features report bugs or even develop plugins to extend its functionality.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

1. **Clonning Project**

    - Clone the project.
  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/iXenonN/YouTube-Music-Profile.git
    ```
  
    - Find the cloned project file in local.
  
    ```
    cd YouTube-Music-Profile
    ```
2. **Installing libraries and requirements**

    - Open app.py with your favorite Python IDE.
    
    - Install the YouTube Music api. (thanks to sigma67 for creating this api)
    
    ```
    pip install ytmusicapi
    ```
    
    - In the cloned file install requirements.txt.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
3. **Editing ytmusicapi credentials and Generate browser.json for ytmusicapi. ("oauth-based authentication has been disabled for the web client by Google")**

   - Open a new tab from your browser. (Firefox recommended)
     
   - Open the developer tools (Ctrl-Shift-I) and select the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù tab.
     
   - Go to https://music.youtube.com and ensure you are logged in.
     
   - Find an authenticated POST request. The simplest way is to filter by '/browse' using the search bar of the developer tools. If you don‚Äôt see the request, try scrolling down a bit or clicking on the library button in the top bar.
  
   - For Firefox verify that the request looks like this: Status 200, Method POST, Domain music.youtube.com, File  ``` browse?...  ```
     - Copy the request headers. (right click > copy > copy request headers)
    
   - For Chromium (Chrome/Edge) verify that the request looks like this: Status 200, Name  ``` browse?... ```
     - Click on the Name of any matching request. In the ‚ÄúHeaders‚Äù tab, scroll to the section ‚ÄúRequest headers‚Äù and copy everything starting from ‚Äúaccept: */*‚Äù to the end of the section.

   - Then, open a console do  ```cd Desktop``` and call.
    ```
    ytmusicapi browser
    ```
   - Paste the request headers that you copied before to the terminal input and click theese keys respectively.
   ```
   Enter, Ctrl+Z, Enter
   ```
   - This command will create a browser.json file in your Desktop.
    
   - In the code change the 'YOUR BROWSER.JSON FILE' with your browser.json file.
    
    ```
    ytmusic = YTMusic('YOUR BROWSER.JSON FILE')
    ```

3. **Firebase Project**

     - Create a new project in Firebase.

    - Change the 'YOUR FIREBASE CRED JSON FILE' with your firebase admin sdk json file.
    
    ```
    cred = credentials.Certificate('YOUR FIREBASE CRED JSON FILE')
    ```
    
    - Paste your firebase project url to the 'YOUR FIREBASE PROJECT URL'.
    
    ```
    firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred {
        'storageBucket': 'YOUR FIREBASE PROJECT URL'
    })
    ```
    
    - Save and exit app.py.

            echo "Current version: $current_version"
            new_version=$((current_version + 1))
            echo "New version: $new_version"
            sed -i "s/v=$current_version/v=$new_version/" README.md
        
    
        - name: Commit Changes
          run: |
            git config --local user.email "YOUR GITHUB EMAIL"

            git add README.md
            git commit -m "Increment SVG version to v${{ steps.increment_version.outputs.new_version }}"
    
        - name: Push Changes
          uses: ad-m/github-push-action@v0.6.0
          with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME }}
            branch: main

## üöß Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### ‚ùå Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some_module'`
  - **Cause:** This error occurs when the required Python package is not installed.
  
  - **Solution:** Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly by running:
  
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  ```

### ‚ùå Issue: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'browser.json'`
  - **Cause:** This error occurs when the project cannot find the browser.json file in the expected directory (It can be ).
  
  - **Solution:** Make sure that browser.json exists in the project's root directory. If it's missing, you can create with the command below (This error may also apply to your firebase-sdk.json. If you see this error message, it is useful       to check your firebase-sdk.json path as well.):
      ```
      ytmusicapi browser
      ```

### ‚ùå Issue: `'ytmusicapi' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`
  - **Cause:** This error occurs when your system cant see the ytmusicapi library (i think).
  
   - **1. Solution:** Add youtubemusicapi into your computers PATH as a enviromental variable. it should be in the
     ```
     C:\Users\{Your Username}\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\Scripts\ytmusicapi.exe
     ```
  
  - **2. Solution:** For me i use windows 11 and i had this issue too but luckily i had a linux installed virtual machine and i executed this command from linux and it worked, so you can try a diffrent operating system and transfer the browser.json file into your main operating system.


### ‚ùå Issue: `google.api_core.exceptions.NotFound: 404 POST [LINK]`
  - **Cause:** This error occurs when your firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred{'storageBucket': '' }) url is wrong.
  
  - **Solution:** Check your firebase project url again and make sure its the right url it should look like this:
      ```
      your-project-name.appspot.com
      ```
    
### ‚ùå Issue: `TimeoutError: [Errno 110] Connection timed out`
  - **Cause:** This error occurs when a network request takes too long to complete, often due to poor network connectivity or an unresponsive server.
  
  - **Solution:** Check your network connection and ensure that the server you are trying to reach is online. You may also increase the timeout limit in your request:
      ```
          response = requests.get(image_url, timeout=10)
      ```
      and:
      ```
          response = requests.get(thumbnail_url, timeout=10)
      ```
    
### ‚ùå Issue: `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present.`
  - **Cause:** This error occurs when your Flask server does not allow cross-origin requests.
  
  - **Solution:** Ensure that flask-cors is installed and properly configured in your Flask application. You can add the following lines to your app.py:
      ```
          from flask_cors import CORS
          app = Flask(__name__)
          CORS(app)
      ```

### ‚ùå Issue: `UI not changing`
  - **Cause:** i really dont know why this happens but i think GitHub's 5k rate limit causes this.
  
  - **Solution:** Just go to the actions tab in your profile's repository and then run the update-readme.yaml that will fix the issue and sometimes ctrl + f5 solves too.
